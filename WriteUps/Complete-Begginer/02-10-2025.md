## Objective
 * To have a general introduction to Cyber Security. Learning it's fundamental concepts such as Blue Team, Red Team, SOC, 
 Penetration Test, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), Threat Intelligence, Malware Analysis.
 * **Tools used on CyberSecurity**: SIEM tool (Security Information and Event Management tool), OPS (Intrusion Prevention System). Example of other tools: Operating System (Windows, Linux), Languages like Phyton and low key languages.
 
## Steps taken
  *  On this room I had a brief exercise that simulated hacking a bank account:
  1. Using the Terminal **Bash** (Linux) I runned a brute force command called Gobuster and found a transfer hidden page on the bank website. 
  2. I successfully transfered U$2000 from a client bank account to mine.

## Lessons learned 
* On this path I learned the particular difference between the Offensive and Defensive Security and how it completes each other. The **Blue Team** is responsible for gathering information, analysing data, controlling systems creating policies and Incident Response. 
  The **Red Team** by the other hand is responsible by playing the attacker position, by exploiting vulnerabilities, pentesting systems, websites and networks for example and giving a solid feedback and report with all the gaps found on the company's security.
