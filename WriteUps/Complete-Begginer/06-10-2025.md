## Objective
 * This room objective is to give a basic introduction to what network is and how it works.
 

## Lessons learned 
* I learned that Network is a wilde concept and it can be divided beetwen private and public network. The internet for example is a giant public network and it's the connection between a uncoountable number of private networks worldwilde. 
* How to identify a device on a network. A device can be identified similar to a human identification, it has a name and a "fingerprint" just like us. The name of a device on a network is known as Internet Protocol adress (the famous IP adress) and the fingerprint of a device is the Media Access Control adress (MAC adress), it is like a serial number of the device.
* Also on this room I learned the fundamentals about PING. It basically uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to determine the performance beetwen devices on a network, for example if the connection exists or is reliable. The sintax to do a Ping is very simple, on the bash or on windows terminal use: ping **IP Adress** or **Website URL**.


## Steps taken - Lab 01
  *  Used another device MAC adress to use a paid Wi-fi connection without paying for the service.
  1. Identified that Alice's packets are going fine through the Website.
  2. Used Alice's MAC address on Bob's device to do the connection beetwen it and the website.

## Steps taken - Lab 02
1. Using the sintax: ping 8.8.8.8 (IP adress) on the bash.
2. Receiving back information about the network performance beetwen devices.
